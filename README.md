## How to run this:

### Note: You need to have Node version 20.x.x to run the code properly

To properly run this, you can run the startup.sh shell script provided. This command installs all dependencies needed using npm and creates a running instance of a peerjs server. With this now setup, you simply need to run a local development version of the website on a localhost url. In this system, each peer is generated by a separate browser tab. Within each tab, you're able to initalize a new "peer" that you can upload files to.

### To go through the proper flow of how to create a peer to peer system using my website, you can follow the following steps:

1. Log in using a peer id of your choice
2. Connect to other peers that are active by typing in their peer id. You can connect to as many as you want!
3. Upload at most 5 files to the file upload area. This is restricted to 5 but can be changed within common.ts.
4. From any peer you can input queries that represent file names of files uploaded in other peers. In other words, you can search for files that are already uploaded in other peers. The current system checks to see if the entire query matches the filename without the extension (e.g. test.txt -> test).
5. When it finishes searching through all peers, the timestamp for how long it took and a blob url is returned to the user. Using the blob url, any peer is able to download another peer's file.

## Scalability:

Given the super quick latency of searching for files, the website is somewhat scalable. Many people could access this website at the same time and send and receive files as they please. However, a lot of the functionalities fall off once larger files are starting to be uploaded at scale.

## Reliability:

A lot of my peer to peer system seems to be reliable due to a lot of guardrails in place. However,

## Anonymity:
