## How to run this:

### Note: You need to have Node version 20.x.x to run the code properly

To properly run this, you can run the startup.sh shell script provided. This command installs all dependencies needed using npm and creates a running instance of a peerjs server. With this now setup, you simply need to run a local development version of the website on a localhost url. In this system, each peer is generated by a separate browser tab. Within each tab, you're able to initalize a new "peer" that you can upload files to.

### To go through the proper flow of how to create a peer to peer system using my website, you can follow the following steps:

1. Log in using a peer id of your choice
2. Connect to other peers that are active by typing in their peer id. You can connect to as many as you want!
3. Upload at most 5 files to the file upload area. This is restricted to 5 but can be changed within common.ts.
4. From any peer you can input queries that represent file names of files uploaded in other peers. In other words, you can search for files that are already uploaded in other peers. The current system checks to see if the entire query matches the filename without the extension (e.g. test.txt -> test).
5. When it finishes searching through all peers, the timestamp for how long it took and a blob url is returned to the user. Using the blob url, any peer is able to download another peer's file.

Measurements:
Latency: On average it took 7ms/query for a ~5 byte file
Throughput: 

## Scalability:

Given the system was built as a web app, there are a lot of perks such as being super easy to scale this product to others. Many people are able to access this url at the same time. However, mainly where it falls of at is how fast people are able to query their requests. The latency that we achieved was with files that were only around 5 bytes big. This means that if we had much bigger files in the megabyte or gigabyte range, it would take much more significant time to query. Therefore, my service is not extremely scalable for a large population of users who are uploading large files. Instead, this system is more meant for a few users who are hoping to share a small amount of files amongst each other.

## Reliability:

A lot of my peer to peer system seems to be reliable due to a lot of guardrails in place. In addition, the website is developed in a way that is super self-explanatory and easy to use- to make this a priority, instructions are even provided above the textfields and buttons. Some fallbacks with the design though mainly deal with small features that were left out. For one, the error checking is done somewhat minimally. In other words, only the main errors are covered and shown through a status popup. One of the other big concerns deal with how bigger files take considerably longer to retrieve. This makes it less reliable to retrieve data super quickly. 

## Anonymity:

This service's anonymity depends on what type of data or tracking that peerjs might be doing. In addition to that, with the dependency, some developers are able to see all open connections currently, events that happened for closed peers, and are able close listening services. However, all of this really depends on how well the website gets deployed on the internet. In the case that lots of security protocols are in place, we'll have a high chance that every user is anonymous. In the case that the deployment isn't super secure, hackers and other developers can probably more easily take advantage of peerjs and attempt to exploit the services.
